# miniRouge

This an implementation of a stripped down version of the open-source UNIX game Rouge built as a project for my Data Structure and Algorithm's course

`game_code` folder contains all the game code (utilities.{h,cpp} were provided by the instructors, all other files are written by me) 

The game can be played by creating an executable using the command `g++ -o miniRouge *.cpp -O2` while in the game_code folder and then running the executable using the command `./miniRouge` on terminal 

`report.docx` contains additional details about this implementation of the game.
